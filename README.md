## 🧠 What This Lab Teaches

- 🔒 **Firewall Basics**: How firewalls control traffic using rules based on ports, protocols, and directions.
- 🖥️ **Windows Firewall**: Using GUI and PowerShell to block/allow traffic.
- 🐧 **Linux UFW**: Using terminal commands to manage firewall rules.
- 🧪 **Testing Rules**: Verifying rule effectiveness using tools like `Test-NetConnection` and `telnet`.
- 📸 **Documentation**: Capturing screenshots and writing clear steps for reproducibility.

## 🧾 Summary of Learnings

- How to **create, test, and delete firewall rules** on both platforms.
- How to **block insecure services** like Telnet (port 23).
- How to **allow secure services** like SSH (port 22).
- How to use **PowerShell and UFW** to verify firewall behavior.
- How to **document technical work** in a structured and professional way.

## 📍 Lab Objectives

1. Open firewall configuration tools (Windows Firewall / UFW).
2. List current firewall rules.
3. Block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet).
4. Test the block using Telnet or PowerShell.
5. Allow SSH (port 22) on Linux.
6. Remove test rules to restore original state.
7. Document all steps and results.
8. Summarize how firewalls filter traffic.
